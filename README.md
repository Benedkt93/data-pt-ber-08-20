# Ironhack Data Analytics Labs

## Working on the Assignments

**To access to the solutions / notes / files that the teaching team uploades**, clone the repo on your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ironhack-datalabs/data-pt-ber-08-20.git
```

By doing that you'll be syncronized with this repo and you'll be able to pull the updates. Here you will not be able to push, so in order to do the labs we want to fork the repo. 


**To work on your first assignment**, create a fork of this repo and clone it to your local machine. 


Each project/lab has its own directory in which you'll find a `README.md` file and a sub-directory named `your-code`. The descriptions and requirements of the assignment can be found in the README file. When you work on the assignment, create your code files in the `your-code` directory and save regularly while you work.

After you finish, add those files to git, commit, and push your branch to GitHub. In the commit message, specify which lab/project you are submitting. For example:

```
$ git add <files-to-add>
$ git commit -m "Module 1 MySQL project"
$ git push origin jenny-doe
```

**To work on the subsequent assignments**, keep using the same forked repo you created and push your new codes to GitHub.

:exclamation: Update your branch regularly because the curriculum development team is developing new assignments for you as the course proceeds. Make sure you have committed all your codes then exectue `git pull origin master` to obtain the latest code from the `master` branch.

### Happy coding!
